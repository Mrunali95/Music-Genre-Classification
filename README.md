# Music Genre Classification
 
In this project, we are classifying genres of music files. We have used GTZAN dataset which contains 1000 music files of 30secs and 10 different genres. We have retrived music features like spectrogram, MFCC etc and applied CNN, RNN and ANN neural networks for genre classsification.
